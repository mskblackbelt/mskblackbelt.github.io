  <p>While mocking up a sample holder, I wanted to go back and edit a pattern object that was embedded in a sketch. Since sketch actions don't appear in the history scrubber (one item for the entire sketch), I couldn't go to my default action of right-click&gt;Edit on the object in the history scrubber.</p>
<p>After a bit of searching, I found an <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/blog/quick-tip-edit-a-sketch-pattern/">old blog post</a> that hinted there was an answer… but the video showing the answer is missing. Instead, I came across a <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/fusion-360-design-validate/modify-sketch-pattern/td-p/5785980">post in the f360 forums</a> that described how and where to make the edit.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, open the sketch to start editing it</li>
<li>Then, double click on the pattern icon (shown in the screenshot below). This will pull up the Edit Pattern dialog, and you can make the required changes. </li>
</ul>

  <p>While trying to post the [previous item][f360-sketch-pattern], I couldn't get the local image to display. I tried placing the PNG file in the post folder with the <code>contents.lr</code> file, then linking with <code>![alt-text](image.png)</code>, but couldn't get the page to render with the image.</p>
<p>I found an old <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40263599/how-can-i-insert-images-in-lektor-markdown-sections">StackExchange response</a> that suggested placing the image in the <code>assets/static</code> folder, then setting the path to <code>/static/assets/image.png</code>, but that didn't net me any results.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, when I view the web editor, the image is listed as an attachment to the page…</p>
<p>As a next step, I started investigating how <a href="https://www.getlektor.com/docs/content/paths/">Lektor handles paths</a>. From a brief read on that page, it seems like the image should be able to reside in the same folder as the post <code>contents.lr</code> file, and the path just needs to be <code>image.png</code>, but this definitely doesn't work. What am I doing wrong?</p>
<h3>--EDIT--</h3>
<p>I'm so dumb… Because of the text cropping, I couldn't tell that the name of my image was misspelled… instead of <code>screenshot_pattern_edit.png</code>, it was named <code>screenshot_patter_edit.png</code>, and that missing "n" made all the difference in the world. Now that I spelled it correctly, the image is attaching correctly. I think I'll stick with Lektor now, since it was <em>entirely</em> my fault.</p>

  <h2>GitHub Pages</h2>
<p>This site is hosted using <a href="https://pages.github.com.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, a hosting service available to all GitHub accounts (for free!). Setting up <a href="https://www.getlektor.com/">Lektor</a> to deploy to GitHub is very simple once you've configured your machine to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh">connect to GitHub using an SSH connection</a>.</p>
<p>Instructions can be found in the <a href="https://www.getlektor.com/docs/deployment/ghpages/">Lektor deployment docs</a>, but here's a brief summary:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Add the following line to your Lektor project config file (<code>project_name.lektorproject</code>) in the root folder of your site:</p>
<pre><code>[servers.ghpages]
target = ghpages://your-user/your-repository
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>If the repository is <code>username.github.io</code>, this will be published to your default user site (<a href="https://username.github.io">https://username.github.io</a>). Otherwise, it will be published to the project-specific page (<a href="https://username.github.io/project-name">https://username.github.io/project-name</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once this is set up, you can deploy the current build of your site by executing <code>lektor build &amp;&amp; lektor deploy</code> from the command line. </li>
</ul>

  <h2>The site</h2>
<p>This site is meant to be a brain dump for the assorted projects and task I take on at Hunter College. I will likely end up being a collection of comments, tips and tricks for specific instruments, and rundowns of my experiences with instrumentation in various states of disrepair. Most of the content is meant to be an easy reference for myself, but hopefully someone else finds bits of it useful.</p>
<h2>How it's made</h2>
<p>This site was designed using <a href="https://www.getlektor.com/">Lektor</a>, a static site generator built in Python. The goals in doing this include those mentioned above (mostly helping me better document my work), learning some simple web design, and giving myself a simple software project to complete.</p>
<p>The steps to create the site are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Python (I use <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv">pyenv</a>)</li>
<li>Create a virtual environment for the site using <a href="https://mamba.readthedocs.io/">Mamba</a>/<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution">Anaconda</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv">pyenv-virtualenv</a>, or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html">venv</a> (I use pyenv-virtualenv, just to keep some consistency, but venv might be easiest, as it's built into modern versions of Python).</li>
<li>After activating the virtual environment, use run <code>pip install lektor</code> (or <code>mamba</code>/<code>conda</code>, if you went that route) to install the site generator. </li>
<li>You can create a blank site template quickly by running <code>lektor quickstart</code> and following the prompts. Just like that, you have an empty site. Time to fill it with knowledge!</li>
</ul>
