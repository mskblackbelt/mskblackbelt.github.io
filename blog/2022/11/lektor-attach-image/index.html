  <p>While trying to post the [previous item][f360-sketch-pattern], I couldn't get the local image to display. I tried placing the PNG file in the post folder with the <code>contents.lr</code> file, then linking with <code>![alt-text](image.png)</code>, but couldn't get the page to render with the image.</p>
<p>I found an old <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40263599/how-can-i-insert-images-in-lektor-markdown-sections">StackExchange response</a> that suggested placing the image in the <code>assets/static</code> folder, then setting the path to <code>/static/assets/image.png</code>, but that didn't net me any results.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, when I view the web editor, the image is listed as an attachment to the page…</p>
<p>As a next step, I started investigating how <a href="https://www.getlektor.com/docs/content/paths/">Lektor handles paths</a>. From a brief read on that page, it seems like the image should be able to reside in the same folder as the post <code>contents.lr</code> file, and the path just needs to be <code>image.png</code>, but this definitely doesn't work. What am I doing wrong?</p>
<h2>EDIT</h2>
<p>I'm so dumb… Because of the text cropping, I couldn't tell that the name of my image was misspelled… instead of <code>screenshot_pattern_edit.png</code>, it was named <code>screenshot_patter_edit.png</code>, and that missing "n" made all the difference in the world. Now that I spelled it correctly, the image is attaching correctly. I think I'll stick with Lektor now, since it was <em>entirely</em> my fault.</p>
