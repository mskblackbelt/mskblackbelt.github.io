  <p>While mocking up a sample holder, I wanted to go back and edit a pattern object that was embedded in a sketch. Since sketch actions don't appear in the history scrubber (one item for the entire sketch), I couldn't go to my default action of right-click&gt;Edit on the object in the history scrubber.</p>
<p>After a bit of searching, I found an <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/blog/quick-tip-edit-a-sketch-pattern/">old blog post</a> that hinted there was an answer… but the video showing the answer is missing. Instead, I came across a <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/fusion-360-design-validate/modify-sketch-pattern/td-p/5785980">post in the f360 forums</a> that described how and where to make the edit.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, open the sketch to start editing it</li>
<li>Then, double click on the pattern icon (shown in the screenshot below). This will pull up the Edit Pattern dialog, and you can make the required changes. </li>
</ul>
