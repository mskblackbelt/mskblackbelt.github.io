One of the places where there are &lt;em>many&lt;/em> options is in the realm of curve fitting. For a simple linear fit, just SciPy and NumPy offer at least three separate options:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Opening files with NumPy</title><link>https://mskblackbelt.github.io/blog/numpy_file_loading/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2024 14:30:13 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://mskblackbelt.github.io/blog/numpy_file_loading/</guid><description>&lt;p>A new tack I&amp;rsquo;m taking this semester is to remove the use of &lt;a href="http://pandas.pydata.org" target="_blank">Pandas&lt;/a> from my Physical Chemistry Lab course. Pandas is an excellent tool with &lt;em>many&lt;/em> evangelists. After some careful examination (and questions from a colleague), I realized that &lt;em>my&lt;/em> reasons for using it the course weren&amp;rsquo;t justified. For the most part, I was using Pandas because it made pretty outputs in a Jupyter notebook… hardly a good reason for introducing a new tool to students already overwhelmed with new tools. In an effort to teach the basics (in this case, Python with NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib), I decided to replace my Pandas calls with their more fundamental equivalents. None of this is to day Pandas isn&amp;rsquo;t an excellent tool, only that I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to use very limited course time to teach an additional tool (and introduce more sources of confusion).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Z-shell completions</title><link>https://mskblackbelt.github.io/blog/zsh_completions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2024 11:15:42 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://mskblackbelt.github.io/blog/zsh_completions/</guid><description>&lt;p>I just spent far too long toying with creating a shell completion for my Zsh setup… On the surface, all I wanted was a simple function to take a graded assignment and return it to a student. Last fall, I put together a script using the &lt;code>install&lt;/code> function to do precisely this (wanted to copy a file owned by my user over to a students folder with the appropriate permissions). The script itself looks like this:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Globbing with `sudo`</title><link>https://mskblackbelt.github.io/blog/globbing_with_sudo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 16:46:20 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://mskblackbelt.github.io/blog/globbing_with_sudo/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ran across an issue I’ve encountered many times before and finally decided it was irritating enough to research. Something I’ve occasionally wanted to do is apply an operation as &lt;code>sudo&lt;/code> to a number of files in a directory or group of directories. The easiest example is listing all the files of a given type from a group of directories.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Creating a network share on Windows 7 (Pro) accessible from Windows NT 4.0</title><link>https://mskblackbelt.github.io/blog/network_share_nt_to_7/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Apr 2023 15:38:56 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://mskblackbelt.github.io/blog/network_share_nt_to_7/</guid><description>&lt;p>A colleague and I set out to rid ourselves of floppy disks in the teaching labs. Several of the control computers in the teaching labs are pretty old, some still still running Windows NT 4.0. Because of software and hardware requirements, OS upgrades are out of the question, and USB and CD-RW support are non-existent in NT. But all the machines are equipped with ethernet, so we decided to set up a small LAN. The trickiest part of the process was getting to the realization that NT 4.0 didn&amp;rsquo;t come with the TCP/IP stack installed by default… we had to pull out the NT install discs and have Windows install that stack before we could communicate with other machines.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to make edits on multiple lines in Vim</title><link>https://mskblackbelt.github.io/blog/vim-comment-edit-lines/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Mar 2023 20:46:20 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://mskblackbelt.github.io/blog/vim-comment-edit-lines/</guid><description>&lt;p>While my preferred (current) editor is &lt;a href="https://nova.app/" target="_blank">Nova&lt;/a>, occasionally I have reason to edit in Vim, particularly when I&amp;rsquo;m working on files on a remote server.

One of the hosts mentions that he keeps around &amp;ldquo;bus wire and spaghetti&amp;rdquo;. Bus wire is just solid core, tinned wire. Spaghetti is a colloquial term for &lt;a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/wire-sleeving" target="_blank">wire sleeving&lt;/a>, and it looks like you can get expandable and regular versions of the insulating stuff (and dozens of other types, including mesh for bundling cables).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thermal Runaway error on Creality Ender 3 Neo</title><link>https://mskblackbelt.github.io/blog/ender3-thermal-runaway/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mskblackbelt.github.io/blog/ender3-thermal-runaway/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just before Christmas, I purchased a Creality Ender 3 Neo (v1) printer on discount. Up to now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with a Monoprice Select Mini Pro (purchased at the start of the pandemic so I could work on 3D modeling projects at home…). That never really took off… partly because the Monoprice machine was soooo difficult to work with that larger prints were impossible. In addition, the bed size on the machine was 6&amp;quot; x 6&amp;quot;, pretty small for a lot of projects.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TIL – How to edit sketch patterns in Fusion360</title><link>https://mskblackbelt.github.io/blog/f360-sketch-pattern/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2022 14:21:20 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://mskblackbelt.github.io/blog/f360-sketch-pattern/</guid><description>&lt;p>While mocking up a sample holder, I wanted to go back and edit a pattern object that was embedded in a sketch.
