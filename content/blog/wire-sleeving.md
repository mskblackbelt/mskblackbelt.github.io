While listening to the [2016 Christmas Shopping Show](https://overcast.fm/+NZ-DxDoKw) of [The Ham Radio Workbench podcast](https://www.hamradioworkbench.com/), I learned about components for making your own wire. One of the hosts mentions that he keeps around "bus wire and spaghetti". Bus wire is just solid core, tinned wire. Spaghetti is a colloquial term for "[wire sleeving](https://www.mcmaster.com/wire-sleeving)", and it looks like you can get expandable and regular versions of the insulating stuff (and dozens of other types, including mesh for bundling cables).
