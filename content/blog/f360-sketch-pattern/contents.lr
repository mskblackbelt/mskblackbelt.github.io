## TIL: How to edit a pattern object in a Fusion360 sketch

While mocking up a sample holder, I wanted to go back and edit a pattern object that was embedded in a sketch. Since sketch actions don't appear in the history scrubber (one item for the entire sketch), I couldn't go to my default action of right-click>Edit on the object in the history scrubber. 

After a bit of searching, I found an [old blog post][f360-defunct-post] that hinted there was an answerâ€¦ but the video showing the answer is missing. Instead, I came across a [post in the f360 forums][f360-forum-post] that described how and where to make the edit. 

- First, open the sketch to start editing it
- Then, double click on the pattern icon (shown in the screenshot below). This will pull up the Edit Pattern dialog, and you can make the required changes.
