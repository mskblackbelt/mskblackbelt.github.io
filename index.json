Something I’ve occasionally wanted to do is apply an operation as sudo to a number of files in a directory or group of directories. The easiest example is listing all the files of a given type from a group of directories.\nIf elevated privileges aren’t required, ls **/*.py will list all the python files in every subdirectory of a given location. However, sudo ls **/*.py will fail with the error that File *.py not found.. A bit of reading revealed that this happens because the action of globbing occurs before the call to sudo happens, so calling sudo doesn’t help to reveal any of the files in inaccessible folders. The way to correct this is to call the ls **/*.py file in a subshell and use sudo to launch the subshell, like so: sudo zsh -c ‘ls **/*.py’. This will run the command as sudo and let the shell do the globbing with the correct privileges. Lesson learned, need to remember to run more commands as subshells!\n","date":"12 January 2024","permalink":"/blog/globbing_with_sudo/","section":"","summary":"Ran across an issue I’ve encountered many times before and finally decided it was irritating enough to research.

My campus connection periodically experiences issues due to any number of things: campus network problems, campus IT problems, campus IT blocking my local router, problems with my local router,1 etc. In fact, I\u0026rsquo;ve been experiencing periodic issues all day.\nI noticed that the Mastodon authentication page was having issues loading… because it\u0026rsquo;s an auth page, Safari won\u0026rsquo;t seem to let you copy the URL.2 in an early attempt to troubleshoot, I tried to load Down for Everyone or Just Me, but that also failed to load. I would have suspected my internet connection itself except that I was in the middle of an iMessage conversation with my wife and Apple Music was streaming without interruption.\nLately, I\u0026rsquo;ve been running [Orion][orion] as my main browser, so I haven\u0026rsquo;t been thinking much about my Safari setup. An odd observation I had was that pages were loading in Orion just fine, suggesting that the network and DNS3 weren\u0026rsquo;t to blame. My next thought was to start disabling as many extensions, apps, etc. as I could (all Safari extensions, my software firewall, assorted background services…). None of this had any effect. Finally, as I was poking through the Safari preferences, I noticed a little box under the Privacy pane for \u0026ldquo;Hide IP Address\u0026rdquo; with a pulldown menu for \u0026ldquo;from Trackers Only\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;from Trackers and Websites\u0026rdquo;. If you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar with this box, it\u0026rsquo;s tied into Apple\u0026rsquo;s [iCloud Private Relay][icloud-relay] service, which promises to \u0026ldquo;protect your privacy when you browse the web in Safari.\u0026rdquo;\nIt seems my campus network is incompatible with the Private Relay service though it works if I switch to \u0026ldquo;from Trackers Only\u0026rdquo;. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s also broken this way, but the break is just localized to tracker loading, and that\u0026rsquo;s a happy side effect if true.\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s my long story about how iCloud Private Relay is still some funny tweaks on technology and the efforts to elude mass data surveillance result in highly inconvenient situations… so hooray capitalism!\nUncommon, and usually fixed with a reboot.

Up to now, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working with a Monoprice Select Mini Pro (purchased at the start of the pandemic so I could work on 3D modeling projects at home…). That never really took off… partly because the Monoprice machine was soooo difficult to work with that larger prints were impossible. In addition, the bed size on the machine was 6\u0026quot; x 6\u0026quot;, pretty small for a lot of projects.\nFast forward to this Christmas, I wanted to make some 3D printed projects for gifts and needed to work on some of them at home. I saw a good price on the Ender 3 Neo v11 and decided to grab it. After some assembly, I had a massive machine on my desk (compared to the Monoprice one), but it had a decent sized glass build plate, auto bed leveling, and the promise of better print quality. I made one or two test prints to check the bed adhesion and leveling with success. Then I tried a longer print (can\u0026rsquo;t even recall what). It looked like everything was going well after 10 minutes, so I went downstairs to grab some dinner. After a few minutes, I hear a raucous beep coming from the printer. When I checked on the screen, it was complaining about a \u0026ldquo;Thermal Runaway\u0026rdquo;.\nI figured this was a one-time issue, so I resliced the print, sent it back over to the machine, and started again. Again, after about 30 minutes, the printer gave off an awful beep and complained about a thermal runaway. This happened a number of times, so I gave up for a bit. I did a bit of research online and a number of posts pointed me toward PID tuning, loose screws on the thermocouple, and suggestions to replace the firmware with Marlin. I checked the screws (tight, no issue) and decided it wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth messing with PID tuning if I was going to replace the firmware… by this time, it was late and I had family coming soon, so I turned off the printer and left it to gather dust for a few weeks.\nThis afternoon, I decided to try to make some progress on the matter. Before pulling the trigger on new firmware,2 I did a bit more reading on the matter on some Stackexchange and Reddit posts. One post in particular suggested the most ridiculous solution… obviously this couldn\u0026rsquo;t possibly the the answer, right!? If you didn\u0026rsquo;t click through, the poster suggested checking to make sure the power supply was set to the right voltage (115V/230V). The only reason this felt ridiculous was that I had to select my voltage and plug locale for the printer on checkout, so I assumed that those values would be correctly configured for my region. Turns out, I was wrong. My power supply was set to 115V. A quick flip of the switch and I\u0026rsquo;m back in business.3\nFollow-up # The printer is working incredibly well. Once I set the voltage correctly and tuned the z-offset, printing in PLA and PETG have been nearly flawless. I need to do a bit of tuning to get rid of some wispy stringing, but it\u0026rsquo;s so light that it just brushes off the surface, more an inconvenience than a real flaw in the prints.\nA travel case for my Pinecil v2 and some accessories printed in blue and yellow PLA. Some wispy bits of PLA can be seen hanging off the hinge. They generally just brush off like spiderwebs. Creality has the worst model distinctions… well, except for Monoprice, Flashforge, and every other inexpensive 3D printer manufacturer\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nI might still do this just because I like some of the features enabled with Marlin.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nHopefully.
