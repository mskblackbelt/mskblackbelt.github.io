  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I'm a research associate in electronics at Hunter College trained in instrumental and inorganic chemistry, specifically in low-temperature optical and nuclear magnetic resonance processes in GaAs (a bit of optics, some cryogenics, some high power RF electronics, and a bit of solid-state physics).</p>
<p>In my current position, I perform routine (and not so routine) maintenance on a number of systems, ranging from rotary evaporators, chillers, and spectrophotometers to triage maintenance on the electron microscope. I also operate the two 3D printers for the chemistry department (an Ultimaker 3 FDM printer and a Form 2 SLA printer). On the side, I've been working to teach myself Python and set up a Jupyter-based curriculum for our second-semester Physical Chemistry lab (kinetics and quantum chemistry).</p>
